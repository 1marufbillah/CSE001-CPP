PROGRAM 1:
Create a class named 'Rectangle' with two data members- length and breadth and a function to calculate the area which is 'length*breadth'. The class has three constructors which are :
1 - having no parameter - values of both length and breadth are assigned zero.
2 - having two numbers as parameters - the two numbers are assigned as length and breadth respectively.
3 - having one number as parameter - both length and breadth are assigned that number.
Now, create objects of the 'Rectangle' class having none, one and two parameters and print their areas.


class Rectangle {
    private:
        int length, breadth;

    public:
        // Constructor with no parameters
        Rectangle() {
            length = 0;
            breadth = 0;
        }

        // Constructor with two parameters
        Rectangle(int l, int b) {
            length = l;
            breadth = b;
        }

        // Constructor with one parameter
        Rectangle(int x) {
            length = x;
            breadth = x;
        }

        // Function to calculate area
        int area() {
            return length * breadth;
        }
};

int main() {
    // Object with no parameters
    Rectangle r1;
    cout << "Area of r1: " << r1.area() << endl;

    // Object with one parameter
    Rectangle r2(5);
    cout << "Area of r2: " << r2.area() << endl;

    // Object with two parameters
    Rectangle r3(4, 5);
    cout << "Area of r3: " << r3.area() << endl;

    return 0;
}

Output:
Area of r1: 0
Area of r2: 25
Area of r3: 20
